## Function

The ``remind2`` library contains the routines to generate the reporting of the output of the REMIND model and is the successor of the deprecated ``remind`` package since REMIND version 3.0. Its main function is to create the output of REMIND as a table in IAM-compatible format, the so-called ``mif-file``, from the ``fulldata.gdx`` of a run. The resulting ``mif-file`` is typically called ``REMIND_generic_NameOfYourRun.mif`` and can be found in the output folder of a run. 

This REMIND reporting based on a GDX-file can be created with the function ``convGDX2MIF()``


```{r, eval = FALSE}
gdx <- "fulldata.gdx"
testReport <- convGDX2MIF(gdx)
```


The calculation of the REMIND variables as reported in the ``mif-file`` is separated into different functions per variable category. For example, ``SE|...`` variables (i.e. Secondary Energy) are calculated in reportSE.R, ``Emi|...`` variables (i.e. Emissions) in reportEmi.R etc. If you only want to check the calculation of a specific group of REMIND variables, you can call those functions directly:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
gdx <- "fulldata.gdx"
testFE <- reportFE(gdx)
```



## Development



When developing the remind2 library, please test your changes on a recent ``fulldata.gdx`` file from REMIND by running the ``convGDX2MIF()`` function. Make sure the ``fulldata.gdx`` file is suitable for testing the change you did. For example, check that the relevant GAMS variables and parameters are available and non-zero in the GDX you are testing. Different REMIND runs come with different module realization and switches where certain sets, parameters or variables are not existing such that your change may not be tested by an unsuitable GDX. Moreover, when adapting or adding variables with "+" notation, please run a summation check on a suitable GDX by running the ``checkIntegrity()`` found [here](https://github.com/pik-piam/remind2/blob/1a80cc607db663a211f98cabb3c7408cd08bf713/tests/testthat/test-convGDX2mif.R#L31) on your reporting output:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
checkIntegrity(testReport)
```


If your change involves reading in a parameter, variable or set from the GDX-file that is not yet merged to the [main REMIND repository](https://github.com/remindmodel/remind) or that is not declared in the default runs of REMIND, please use conditional statements that check whether these parameters exist. Otherwise, the reporting will break for other users with other GDX files. 


## REMIND Variable Naming

There are a couple of naming conventions for variables in the REMIND mif-file:

* variables typically follow the structure ``Variable Type|...|Sector1|Sector2|â€¦|Energy Carrier Output|Energy Carrier Origin`` (Example: ``FE|Industry|Liquids|Biomass`` contains liquid fuel used as final energy in industry that is produced from biomass)
* variables including one or several "+" in the name are subject to an automated summation check by ``test-convGDX2mif.R`` when building the library (for the naming convention of variables with "+", see below)  
* modifications of standard variables like ``|w/ Bunkers|``, ``|before taxes|`` or ``|gross|`` should be placed at the highest relevant aggregation level (examples: ``Emi|CO2|Gross|Energy|Supply|+|Liquids``, ``FE|w/ Bunkers|+|Transport``)
* variables which should not be used for papers or external projects and which were added solely for diagnostic or debugging purpose should start with ``Internal|...``

Several variable types are structured in a variable tree using "+" notation their name. This means that it is checked that a group of variables sums up to an aggregate variable. All variables with a "+" should sum up to the super-variable corresponding to the part of the name before the "+". For example:


```
FE = FE|+|Electricity + FE|+|Heat + FE|+|Hydrogen + FE|+|Solids ...
```


However, multiple stages of summations should only feature one "+" at the lowest level of aggregation and not multiple "+" levels (so ``Emi|CO2|Energy|+|Demand`` instead of `Emi|CO2|+|Energy|+|Demand`). If there are multiple different variable groups that belong to one super variable, additional pluses are added to distinguish them for the other variable groups. For example:



```
FE = FE|+|Electricity + FE|+|Heat + FE|+|Hydrogen + FE|+|Solids ...

FE = FE|++|Buildings + FE|++|Industry + FE|++|Transport ...
```

You can check out the different summation groups of variables with "+" by running the function ``extractVariableGroups()`` from the [mip-package](https://github.com/pik-piam/mip#readme). The argument to the function is a vector of variable names. For example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mip::extractVariableGroups(getNames(testReport, dim=3))
```


The REMIND reporting will provide you with two different mif-files. The standard mif-file will come with "+" notation, while a second mif-file "without_plus" is generated where pluses were deleted to ease further processing. 

Note that the definitions of REMIND variables as generated by the ``remind2`` library may not correspond to the definition of equally or similarly named variables in standardized model intercomparison projects. For mappings of REMIND variables to variable templates from model intercomparison projects, please see the pik-piam library [project_interfaces](https://github.com/pik-piam/project_interfaces).
